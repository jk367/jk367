Hi, my name is James Kettle and I am recent graduate from Columbia University. In 2023 I completed a degree in Information science (a mix of computer science and sociology). I have been living in Tbilisi working as a Math teacher since the summer of 2023 and I am returning to NYC in January of 2024 looking for full time work. 

My general interests include Human Computer Interaction, Generative AI, Mathematics education.
